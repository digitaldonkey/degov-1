Feature: deGov - Entity browser

  Background:
    Given I proof that the following Drupal modules are installed:
      | degov_node_normal_page      |

  Scenario: Entity browser has only expected tabs
    Given I have dismissed the cookie banner if necessary
    And I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    And I am on "/node/add/normal_page"
    And I press the "edit-field-teaser-image-entity-browser-entity-browser-open-modal" button
    Then I should see HTML content matching '<iframe src="/entity-browser/modal/media_browser' after a while
    When I wait for AJAX to finish
    And I switch to the "entity_browser_iframe_media_browser" frame
    Then I should see 6 ".eb-tabs > ul > li" elements
    And I should see text matching "Library"
    And I should see text matching "Bilder Hochladen"
    And I should see text matching "Hochladen"
    And I should see text matching "Dokumente Hochladen"
    And I should see text matching "Create embed"
    And I should see text matching "Audio hochladen"

    And I should see 3 ".view-filters input" elements
    And I should see text matching "Interner Titel"
    And I should see text matching "Ã–ffentlicher Titel"
    And I should see text matching "Filter"
    # The Library widget should only display images.
    And I should see 5 ".views-row > img" elements

#    When I choose "Inhalt" from tab menu
#    And I press the "edit-field-content-paragraphs-add-more-add-modal-form-area-add-more" button
#    And I click "Medienreferenz"
